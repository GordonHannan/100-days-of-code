# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 0: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Installed git and started becoming familiar with how it works. I completed 113 exercises in freeCodeCamp.com (Finished HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, and Basic Front End Development Projects.

**Thoughts**: 
I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, and some basics of Bootstrap so that went really quick. I haven't worked with jQuery before, and while it was interesting, it wasn't too hard. I would have liked to get into it a little more in depth, but I guess it's just an introduciton. I found the Bootstrap portion of the last Basic Front End Development Projects to be fairly difficult. I had a decent amount of trouble figuring out the ScrollSpy portion as well as the collapseable menu. I feel like I learned a decent amount about setting ScrollSpy/Menu stuff up. My pace will most definitely slow in the up coming days!

**Link to Work**: 
I did a tribute page (as per freeCodeCamp's lessons) and picked Linus Tolvalds. It's super basic HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. I've done better design, but the aim was to have no custom CSS. I only cheated on the font and body margin.

(note: I still need to add links to social media to finish freeCodeCamp's requirements)


Day 1: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
I updated the CodePen for the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage Complete" project. I added social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I also added a footer bar. I messed around with the colour scheme a bit to make the headers in section 1 and section 3 white. I changed the main background to the grey colour. Prior to this, there were white gaps on the footer where it has the rounded corners. I removed the "darkGreyBG" class from the CSS as well as from the col-3 on the left and right sides of the page. I added a section 2 class to the CSS that includes a white background and black text. I also linked up https://digitallysmarter.com.

**Thoughts**:
It was a bit frustrating having left the Portfolio page so close to complete, but I'm glad I left it and came back. It took about an hour to finish off and I was able to correct other small issues that were bugging me. I noticed that when I click on the links, it jumps to the place on the page. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be smoothly scrolling, but I've found documentation on Bootstrap 4 beta to be a bit confusing. Perhaps this is a Bootstrap 4 beta thing?
