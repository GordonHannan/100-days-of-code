# 100 Days Of Code - Log
Day 0: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed git and started becoming familiar with how it works. 
		      I completed 113 exercises in freeCodeCamp.com (Finished HTML5 and CSS,
                      Responsive Design with Bootstrap, jQuery, and the first two of three
		      of Basic Front End Development Projects.

**Thoughts**: I was already familiar with HTML and CSS, and some basics of Bootstrap so that went really quick.
	      I haven't worked with jQuery before, and while it was interesting, it wasn't too hard. I would have
  	      liked to get into it a little more in depth, but I guess it's just an introduciton.

**Link to Work**: I did a basic tribute page (as per freeCodeCamp's lessons) and picked Linus Tolvalds.
		  It's super basic HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. I've done better design, but the aim was to have no
		  custom CSS. I only cheated on the font and body margin.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
